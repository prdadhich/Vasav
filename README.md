Building my own 3d engine
In the start I am following tutorial from https://github.com/TheCherno
Later when I am more comfortable with c++ and reached to stage where I can implement my own logics and functionality to the engine, I will....

But the main aim here is to learn the core to what goes inside the 3d engines so that I can work better with the awesome engines already out there
